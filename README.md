# Histology-Analysis
The Histology Categorization Analysis Tool (HCAT) is an image analysis pipeline intended to provide preliminary discrimination between tissue, implant, and empty space present on histological images generated by an animal study on the effectiveness of a novel implant at adhering to skin. HCAT is a multi-step image analysis pipeline that primarily relies on K-means clustering to classify pixels. Because pixels corresponding to empty space and the implant have similar values in RGB space, K-means clustering with K=2 clusters is effective at separating pixels corresponding to tissue from those corresponding to empty space and the implant. To separate empty space and implant pixels, K-means clustering is repeated while ignoring pixels already identified as tissue. Because pixels corresponding to the implant have greater variance in RGB space than pixels corresponding to empty space, more than 2 clusters are needed to separate implant from empty space. Since empty space pixels are closest to the background color—white—they are identified by selecting the cluster centered at the largest value in RGB space. Though we report results using K=4 clusters for this step, at least K=3 clusters are needed in order to separate empty space from implant. Median filtering is employed after each K-means clustering step to smooth the resulting classification while preserving local features. Once pixels corresponding to empty space and tissue have been identified, anything left un-classified must correspond to the implant. The number of pixels in each category is then tabulated to allow for the estimation of metrics of interest: infill (how much available space is filled by tissue) and porosity (how much of the total area is not occupied by the implant). The final image is produced by recoloring the pixel categories so that background manually identified to be outside of the implant is shown in grey, implant is shown in black, tissue is shown in purple, and empty space is shown in white.
